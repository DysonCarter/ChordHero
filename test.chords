}

Verse_1 {
    If [D]you, if you could return
    Don't let it [A 6]burn, don't let it fade
    I'm sure I might be [C add9]rude
    But it's just your attitude
    It's tearing me a[G]part
    It's ruining everything 
}

Chorus {
    But I'm in so [D]deep
    You know I'm such a [A 6]fool for you
    You got me wrapped around your [C add9]finger
    Do you have to let it [G/B]linger
    Do you have to, do you have to
    DO you have to let it [D]linger
}
