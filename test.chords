Linger - The Cranberries

Intro {
    [1, 5, 6 maj, 4]
}

Verse_1 {
    If [1]you, if you could return
    Don't let it [5 6]burn, don't let it fade
    I'm sure I might be [6 majadd9]rude
    But it's just your attitude
    It's tearing me a[4]part
    It's ruining everything 
}

Chorus {
    But I'm in so [1]deep
    You know I'm such a [5 6]fool for you
    You got me wrapped around your [6 majadd9]finger
    Do you have to let it [4]linger
    Do you have to, do you have to
    DO you have to let it [1]linger
}
